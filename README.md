Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Idea is to make a AI based program that can calculate the odds for intrucian alarm calls in a certain site based on the history of the site.  


## Background

This can cut the alarm call costs of a site by increasing the knowledge.


## How is it used?

By inseting data gatherd to alarm centers from predefined sites, we are able to have backround information for building neural network code.

## Data sources and AI methods


## Challenges

Challenge is that there is always a human factor in these situations. The end users of intrucion alarm system can't always operate with it.

## What next?
